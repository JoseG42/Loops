# Loops
PYT-102 Loops scenario 1, 2, 3, and extra credit
classroom attendance has a list for names and a list for attendance status. The variables for names and status are set to an empty string.
While student name is not 'done': the program will ask user input for the student name, and their attendance status, it then adds both to the corresponding list and prints them. After the user inputs each name, the program checks if the name is already in the list, if true, it displays an error and breaks the loop.
